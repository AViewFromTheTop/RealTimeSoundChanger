# Real-Time Sound Changer

Lets you control each individual sound of Minecraft's blocks by only dragging and dropping .ogg files!

# HOW TO USE:
1. Launch the game.
2. Close the game and navigate to the resourcepacks folder. Open the resource pack named "new_sounds."
3. Open assets, minecraft, sounds, block, and you'll see a folder for every vanilla block in the game.
4. Find the folder for the block you want to edit, then put mono .ogg files into the place, break, step, hit, and fall folders, for each block sound you wish to replace.
5. Relaunch the game, and you'll be able to hear you brand new custom block sounds!

# FAQ:
Q: Do I have to worry about creating the resource pack?
A: Nope! This mod automatically creates it for you.

Q: Do I have to edit sounds.json for this to work?
A: Nope! Once again, this mod automatically creates sounds.json each time Minecraft launches.

Q: Is there a way to turn this off?
A: There is! Run the command /rtsc disable to disable your custom sounds, and /rtsc enable to re-enable them.

Q: My sounds won't play, what am I doing wrong?
A: All sounds must be in the .ogg format, and can only have ONE channel; they can not be stereo. If you've done this and they still won't play, make sure the resource pack named "new_sounds" is applied.

Q: I deselected the resource pack, and now the block sounds won't play!
A: Be sure to always keep the resource pack enabled, otherwise the sounds may get messed up. You can run /rtsc disable to switch back to the original sounds, so don't worry about it!
